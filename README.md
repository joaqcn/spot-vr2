## Introduction

This is the continuation from this repo {https://github.com/joaqcn/spot-vr} 

This project aims to create a virtual simulation of the Boston Dynamics Spot robot using Unity, specifically designed to be controlled with Oculus Quest 3 controllers. The virtual Spot robot is a quadruped robot designed for a variety of applications, including inspection, surveillance, and research.

## Features

- Realistic simulation of Spot's locomotion and movement capabilities within the Unity environment.
- Interaction and control using Oculus Quest 3 controllers for an immersive experience.
- Customizable environment for testing and experimentation.
- Integration with Unity's XR toolkit for VR development(Still in Development)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity 
- Oculus Integration Package for Unity
- Oculus Quest 3 with controllers


### Usage

1. Deploy the Unity project to your Oculus Quest 3 device.
2. Put on your Oculus Quest 3 headset and hold the controllers.
3. Follow on-screen instructions or controller mappings to control the virtual Spot robot.

### Examples
 - Coming soon
