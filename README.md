## Introduction

This project aims to create a virtual simulation of the Boston Dynamics Spot robot using Unity, specifically designed to be controlled with Oculus Quest 3 controllers. The virtual Spot robot is a quadruped robot designed for a variety of applications, including inspection, surveillance, and research.

## Features

- Realistic simulation of Spot's locomotion and movement capabilities within the Unity environment.
- Interaction and control using Oculus Quest 3 controllers for an immersive experience.
- Customizable environment for testing and experimentation.
- Integration with Unity's XR toolkit for VR development(Still in Development)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity
